# ECE-198-Salinity-Tester

This is the repo for our salinity tester's code.

As climate change continues to worsen, more of the world continues to feel its effects. However, not all areas are affected equally. Species native to warmer climates are migrating north/south, glaciers are melting, and historically wetter areas are experiencing record-breaking levels of dryness.

One of the areas most affected by the warming of the planet is that of coastal areas, due to the rising sea levels. As such, regions at or below sea level are facing increasing risks of saltwater intrusion.

This project aims to provide those affected by saltwater intrusion with a cheap method to detect salinity in water.

Meeting November 7th.

Implementation demo Week of November 21st.
